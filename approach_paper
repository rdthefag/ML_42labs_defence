*****Document Overview*****Rohan Datta
To develop a solution for organizing intelligence data available from multiple agencies in structured/ semi-structured/ unstructured forms and correlate to event matrix under big data framework alongwith tools to analyse patterns for predictive anaylsis. The application should be capable of identifying triggers in terms of identified activities which  may lead to an impending event. This document states one method of doing so by putting forward an automated machine learning solution to overcome the challenge faced by the militaries in terms of overflow of data and no sufficient manpower or processing power to do the same. Thus machine learning can be implemented to automate the categorising of military data and prediction of certain events and alert system for the same. This can also be used to predict the outcomes of strategies and thus act as a simulator for certain events and help in making counteracting strategies. Thus this trained model will be able to provide strategic, predictive alarming support and further increase the relevance of the large amounts of military data by parsing it through an automated product which will not ignore a single detail.
    With this paper, we intend to further the data analytics and collection departments of military systems and make advances in the field of information and cyber security.

*****Time Frame****Rohan
The project work shall be divided between four people and will have a time period of 8-12 weeks. The work shall be ditributed over workforce and time as follows:

Week 1(Tentatively from May,28th,Monday)
    ***these will be bullet points***
    Collection of data using scrapy spider starts. This is basic data gathering stage and will take 2-3 days. All data gathered will be further analysed.
    Data will be now analysed and filtered superficially to ignore all external misguiding references. Meanwhile a python/octave script to be written to start Data Preprocessing.
    According to data abundancy and credibility, algorithm to be run to be decided(simple regression,SVM,etc.).
    
    Deliverables of the week: Rough data metrics to be given out along with tentative algorithm selection
    
Week 2(4th June)
    The collected data is now organised and will be preprocessed to rectify missing values, invalid data and nonsense data.
    Further, the entire dataset is assembled and preprocessing starts to rectify all data.
    
    Deliverables of the week: Preview of dataset and tentative features selection.
    
Week 3(11th June)
    Previous renderings of the idea are searched once again to 

*******Approach and Methodology***********
There are significant potential benefits to developing predictive methods  of  defending  against  adaptive  adversaries,  in  which  opponents evolving  strategies  are  anticipated  and  these  in-sights are employed to counter novel attacks. This section considers the following  concrete  instantiation  of  the  predictive  defense problem, given some history of attacker actions we will design a defense system which performs well against both current and future attacks.

All security tasks can be put into five categories: Prediction, Prevention, Detection, Response and Monitoring.

Our Project will help to include :

1.Regression: Regression, or in other words prediction, is a simple task.The proposed approach to designing a predictive defense system which works well against both current and future attacks. We want to utilize our knowledge about existing data to make opinions on new data.In Defence, it can be implemented to predict the stratergies of the Enemy force and is capable of identifying triggers in terms of identified activities which  may lead to an impending event.The difficulty of deriving realistic representations for attacker behavior is overcome by recognizing that the actions of attackers that can be modeled as attempts to transformdata in such a way that malicious and innocent activities are indistinguishable. It is possible to model attacker actions as transformations of data because, within the problem formulation, historical attack data are available in the form of training instances. Therefore, we are predicting the attacker strategy through computation of attack and then learning an appropriate countermeasure by applying ML to the transformed data.  

2.Classification: In this the objective is to distinguish innocent and malicious activity.  

3.Clusterization:  

4.Recommendation: It can be used primarily in incident response. If a defence force faces a wave of incidents and offers various types of responses, our system can learn what type of response it should recommend for a particular incident. Risk management solutions can also benefit in that they automatically assign risk values for new vulnerabilities or misconfigurations built on their description.

We can solve all of them with different levels of efficiency for various needs.

Short paragraph on project, mainly in bullet points along with
how the project team will be organized, what development and collaboration tools will be used, 
and how the plan will be updated along the way.

****Work Breakdown****Akash
Akash Ramdev- NLP for taking in data and figuring out how to organise clusters of words to fit a certain classification such that 
a certain logic can be derived from whatever data we get.

Akshay Ramdev- NLP filtering to find better models to fixate on certain keywords and then make a scenario in data to give to the model. 

Saloni Verma- Spider deployment using python (scrapy) and data collection and basic analysis to deem a sample worth of use.

Rohan Datta- Creation of a deep recursive neural network or scalar vector machine depending on requirements and availability of data.

Front end and presentation to be equally divided among the members.
*****Project Risk Management****Akash
Risks:
1. Outdated or incomplete information may persist due to the cost and/or effort of obtaining up-to-date information
2. Malicious parties may corrupt data (for example, cybercrime activity that alters data and documents)
3.An organization that uses multiple data sources may incorrectly interweave data sets and/or be unaware of causal relationships
between data points and lack proper data governance mechanisms to identify these inconsistencies.

****Conclusion****Saloni
Machine learning has been gaining popularity immensely over the years. Combining huge amount of data base with the machine
is helping in great technological advancements. Likewise, creating a program that challenges the designers in creating
an adaptive AI opponent that provides a war strategy and focuses on tactical and strategic aspects of war play, can be majorly 
applied for strategic predictions. There are substantial potential benefits to considering predictability when designing defenses 
against adaptive adversaries, including increasing the ability of defense systems to predict new attacker behavior and
reducing the capacity of adversaries to anticipate defensive actions. This paper adopts such a perspective, leveraging 
the coevolutionary relationship between attackers and defenders to derive methods for predicting and countering attacks and
for limiting the extent to which adversaries can learn about defense strategies. These results basically indicate that the
algorithms have foresight of the opponentâ€™s strategy. Given this ,the machine learning algorithms outperforms the opponent.
